Purescript bindings for [Material UI next](https://material-ui-next.com/)

The component functions are auto-generated from the typescript bindings, so it should be easy to keep up with the releases.

Yes, this basically has the same goal as [purescript-react-material-ui](https://github.com/nwolverson/purescript-react-material-ui). Rather than being purescript-options based, this library uses Arrays with a phantom record type, essentially using the same technique as Halogen.

This library is considered Alpha until Material UI next is out of beta.
