# purescript-react-mui

Purescript bindings for [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

The component functions are auto-generated from the Typescript bindings, so it should be easy to keep up with the releases.

These bindings are based on [purescript-tscompat](http://github.com/doolse/purescript-tscompat).
